**New Research Preprint Available! 🚀**

We are excited to share our latest research on **six-component (6C) ground motion monitoring**:

**📄 Preprint:** [Single-Station 6C Seismic Source Tracking](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/7869/)

**🔬 Key Innovation:**
• Single-station system using six-component ground motion data
• Combines translational + rotational motion measurements
• Accurately tracks seismic sources (e.g., vehicles) in challenging environments
• **No large arrays required!**

**🌍 Applications:**
• Urban monitoring systems
• Geohazard warning systems
• Infrastructure monitoring
• Traffic analysis

**📚 Access:** Available on [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/7869/)
