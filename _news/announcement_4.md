**🚀 Exciting News! My First Lead-PI Research Project Has Been Funded by USGS! 🎉**

I'll be measuring **six-component vibrations** along the Reno-Carson City corridor, creating a computational tool for **site-specific Vs30 estimations**!

**💰 Funding Source:** United States Geological Survey (USGS)
**🎯 Project Scope:** Six-component vibration measurements
**📍 Study Area:** Reno-Carson City corridor
**🔬 Research Focus:** Site-specific Vs30 estimation tools

**🔬 Technical Approach:**
• Six-component (6C) ground motion measurements
• Advanced computational tool development
• Site-specific Vs30 estimation methods
• Regional seismic characterization

**🌍 Impact:**
• Improved seismic hazard assessment
• Better understanding of local site effects
• Enhanced computational tools for engineers
• Regional seismic monitoring advancement

**💡 Significance:** This represents a major milestone in my research career as the first project where I serve as the lead Principal Investigator, demonstrating the importance of six-component measurements in modern seismology.

*Stay tuned for updates on this exciting research project!*
