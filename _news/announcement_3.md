**New Research Preprint Available! 📝**

**Curious about estimating site-specific seismic velocity changes (dv/v)?** Our latest work employs **six-component (6C) single-station seismic measurements** for structural health monitoring.

**📄 Preprint:** [6C Single-Station Measurements for Site-Specific Seismic Velocity Changes](https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/4004)

**🔬 Research Focus:**
• Site-specific seismic velocity change estimation
• Six-component (6C) single-station measurements
• Structural health monitoring applications
• Advanced seismic monitoring techniques

**🌍 Applications:**
• Infrastructure monitoring
• Structural health assessment
• Seismic hazard evaluation
• Engineering applications

**💡 Innovation:** This research demonstrates how 6C measurements can provide more comprehensive data for structural health monitoring compared to traditional single-component approaches.

**📚 Access:** Available on [EngrXiv](https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/4004)
